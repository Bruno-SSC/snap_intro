    Set up everything (including netlify/gh) and did most of the mobile design. Currently working on the side menu for it.
com1
    Finished the mobile. Not responsive/animated. 
com2
    Created isolated components for reusable components. Also created a service to manage device and sidemenu state with Subjects to update components that might need this data.

    Specifically struggling with how to deal with the modal dropdown in the desktop. Probably same problem I got stuck last attempts.
com4 
    Managed to implement the dropdown modal. Not sure if I like how I did it but it works for now.
com5
    got rid of the ng-container/ng-template approach and focused on ngIf and styling only.
com6
    finally achieved a decently looking arrange of mobile/desktop versions. Now I can focus on the styling for each block in both versions individually while making device-based layout changes solely on one component.
